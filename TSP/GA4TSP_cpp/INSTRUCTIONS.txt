Open terminal and cd to the code folder.
Execute the following commands to build and run the codes:

mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
./main

When the codes are build and run successfully, you need to run only the last two commands to re-build and run the codes.

Try to modify the parameters, such as population size, mutation rate, crossover rate, etc and see how the result changes.
You can try other evolutionary operators like Two point crossover, Order crossover, PMX crossover, Cyclic crossover, inversion mutation, etc.
